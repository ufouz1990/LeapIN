Current Features
--

- Transparent window with green border to show window (will be removed at release)
- Mouse cursor can be moved.
- Mouse clicks can be handled if the window is 100% transparent, however the cursor can only be changed in the opposite way; this means that an alpha of 1 can be taken away, clicks can be handled and then the alpha be re-applied. This should enable both functionalities. Data triggers!
